# Regolith Desktop Environment

Regolith Desktop Environment is a polished, productivity-focused computer interface.  It combines the light-weight and efficient UI metaphor of tiling window management with the usability of gnome.

# Screens

![After login](assets/screenshot-empty.png?raw=true "After login.")

By default, Regolith reserves all screen space to applications. All you see here is wallpaper.

![Regolith Bar](assets/screenshot-bar.png?raw=true "Regolith Bar")

Holding the *[meta]* key (by default the Windows key) will cause the bar to pop-up from the bottom of the screen.  The bar displays state about your working environment such as open workspaces as well as basic computer statistics such as CPU load and power information.

![App Launcher](assets/screenshot-rofi-run.png?raw=true "App Launcher")

Your applications can be quicky launched via the [app launcher](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi).  *[meta]*-space presents a list of recently used apps.  The list is filtered as you type the name of the app you wish to launch.

![Windows](assets/screenshot-windows.png?raw=true "Windows")

Regolith relies on [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/) to allow application windows to utilize your entire screen. Gain efficiency by spending less time micro-managing your application windows.

![Window Switcher](assets/screenshot-window-switcher.png?raw=true "Window Switcher")

Quickly switch between applications with *[meta]*-w, which invokes the window switcher dialog.

![System Settings](assets/screenshot-settings.png?raw=true "System Settings")

Gnome deals with system configuration with a clean UI for managing wireless connections, monitors, and other details.
